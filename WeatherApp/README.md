- Assets: The `images` folder contains icons used in the app's interface. You can replace them with your own if desired.

- Styling: The app's visual style is defined in the `style.css`, `media.css` and `location-slider.css` file. You can customize the styles to fit your preferences.

Feel free to explore the code in the `script.js` file to see how the app functions.
